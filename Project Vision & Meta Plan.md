# GM Tool Project â€” Early Development Snapshot

## ðŸ§  Project Vision

User interface to simplify and enable the space scifi tabletop game Gargantua enabling complex interaction through a traditional interface and an LLM based chat interface.

## Project Meta Goals

### Stephen:

- Practice rapid application development + integrate AI into workflow to prep for re-entry into the workforce
- Adapt project management style to current AI trends + personal cognitive/memory bandwidth challenges through clearer planning, documentation of models, architecturer, and primary task function paths, and using chunked tasks and clearer mental scaffolds
- Learn modern JS UI frameworks:
  - Primary: Svelte (main app)
  - Secondary: React (Supabase tools, Auth UI)
- Explore and apply chat-based interfaces for tool/function invocation and workflows
- Improve internal boundary-setting: learn to say "no" to overly complex or high-scope ideas, despite intellectual curiousity

### Scott

- Build and run Gargantua with friends, a custom space-themed TTRPG
- Learn marketable technical skills (with emphasis on SQL, data analysis, and modern JS UI frameworks)
- Contribute a tool to the tabletop gaming communityâ€”with possible future monetization if thereâ€™s enough interest

### High Level Projects

1. Product/Project Planning
   - Plan/Document Process, Services, Tools & Documentation for both creative process and technical architecture
   - Create a spike solution to test
   - Ensure they are in a format that can be edited/read by people and AI
2. Generate Initial Concept
   * Game Design Document
   * Use Cases and/or Interaction Flow Diagrams
   * Definie project milestones/goals and organize
3. Build, Test, Iterate:
   * **MVP** - Primary Architecture in place, can manually perform core actions
   * **MVP-LLM** - MVP + LLM Integration working for function calling/tool integration
   * **Alpha** - Good enough for**Scott** to try playing with friends
   * **Beta** - Good enough for**Strangers** to try playing with friends
   * **Release Candidate** - Good enough to charge money for
