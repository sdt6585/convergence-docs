## Convergence

A small crew braves the final frontiers of deep space. Chart your course across the galaxy to find adventure and plunder. Will you join the fabulously wealthy Free Traders and take your pick of the choicest treasures? Do the glories of imperial conquest promise your name enshrined in statues across star systems? Or will you become a feared pirate and fly where you please? 
 
 
The choice is yours as you and your crew set your names amongst the stars.
## Gameplay
Every action you take will involve some kind of roll, usually a skill or stat check. The standard roll is a d15, where the maximum value is 15 and the minimum value is 1. When you roll a 15 you have a critical success, which means you get to roll an additional time and that roll to your total. You may keep rolling until you not roll a crit.

When you roll a 1 it is a critical failure, which means you automatically do not pass.

Luck Die: Every time you roll a standard skill or stat roll, a luck die rolls in the background. This is a d30, and if it lands in a 1-29, nothing happens. If you roll a 30 (or your luck adds up to 30) you have a cosmic moment, which means you gain a free re-roll to use at your choice. Your luck stat is added to every luck roll.

## Factions



* Confederation of Allied Races
* Free Traders
* Corsairs


## Classes

There are many types of adventures in the galaxy, each a little different from the last. As you forge your legacy in the stars you’ll have the chance to learn new skills that open up new opportunities.

Each of the classes can specialize into multiple roles and playstyles. Using skills will increase their stat value over time, which will increase your success rate, damage, and unlock more powerful items.

After you increase 3 core skill levels within a given subclass you will gain access to a new Tier. Tiers unlock additional stat bonuses and abilities. Once you max out the Tiers on your selected subclass, you may continue on an additional subclass or multiclass into another Class entirely.


### Pilot

Pilots are the navigators of stars. They can chart courses through slip space jumps, deftly land in adverse conditions, and dogfight enemy craft. Pilots commonly use their skills to control drones and automatons outside of the air as well. This comes at the expense of their training with larger handheld weapons. Pilots will often be capable of doing maintenance and repairs on common space craft.

### Cybernetics

Cybernetics include both mechanical and biological enhancements that add abilities and improve skills. Cybernetics must be an installed by a character with skill level. The cybernetic installation and calibration process is complex and takes multiple checks, commonly including computer engineering, hardware maintenance, and first aid.

Cybernetics must be attached to a core anatomical area, which vary somewhat based on species but are essentially limited to:



* Sensory organs, face
* Limbs, upper, grasping and tool usage
* Limbs, lower, mobility 
* Internal, changes the bodies biological processes

On successful installation and calibration the character adds the associated ability to their profile.

If a cybernetic is a weapon or tool, it is counted as equipped whenever the player chooses.


#### Example Cybernetics

**Multi-Spectrum Ocular Implant**

Ability: Allows the user to see in ultraviolet and infrared 

Attachment: sensory

**Forelimb Dart Launcher**

Attachment: single limb

Class: pistol

Range: 10 m

Damage: 1d6

Ability: Darts may be poisoned with purchased darts or the requisite first aid skill

Referenced skill: Pistols


### Spacecrafts

Spacecraft come in a broad variety of sizes and capabilities, and will not be listed exhaustively here. They can be classified in size as:



* Patrol craft
* Cruiser/Freighter
* Battleship
* Command Center

Larger craft often tow or dock a small Patrol Craft to operate as a lander or gun boat.

**Navigating through Space**

Deep space exploratory craft are equipped with a slip-space portal generator to make leaps across space. All craft are equipped with antimatter engines. Antimatter engines at their uppermost velocity can reach 0.5c or half the speed of light, with a Delta-V dependent on local gravitational forces. Antimatter is difficult to refuel on the fly, so having plan for getting back home is always critical

**Slip-Space Portals**

Slip-Space Portals are the common parlance for Einstein-Rosen Bridges or wormholes. Casamir Alloy is used to open and maintain a portal to another point in space. This material is extremely heavy and costly, so most vessels can only make 2-4 jumps before needing to replace their Casamir stores. 

Portals are easier to maintain when the aperture is maintained on both ends, as is the case for CAR Transport Gates. These are the lifeblood of intergalactic commerce and sub-light shipping lanes that can still reach far flung start systems. Transport Gates are maintained by the CAR and typically require a toll to use. They commonly have access points at major trade and entertainment planet as well as the core shipping lanes. The highest density of transport gates is the Lodestone (see also Heaven's Gate), a supermassive black hole at the center of the galaxy.


#### Bays

All Ships are designed to be modular and configured to the needs of its intended mission. While at least half of the gross tonnage of a ship will be committed to fuel, engine, maintenance, and hull, the rest of the ship can be configured to the needs of its crew. The size of the ship will determine how many bays are available. Visit your local shipyard for more customization options.

**Crew Quarters:**

Accommodates basic necessities for the crew including bunks, kitchen, showers, and waste disposal. Available crew quarter space will depend on the size of the ship. A ship outfitted with Crew Quarters will allow the crew to take a full rest cycle.

**Medical Bay:**

Fully automated and custom medical equipment for everything from the treatment of minor illnesses to synthetic organ transplants. When a crew member is downed, if they are returned to the Medical Bay before perishing they are immediately stabilized as long as the ship has power.

**Engineering Bay:**

Allows for custom built mechanical devices including drones, cybernetic limbs, and weapons. Also allows for more complex repair and hacking operations that can’t be completed in the field.

**Cargo Bay:**

Stores all your valuable loot. Merchant freighters will commonly have more than one cargo bay to maximize profit potential.

**Torpedo Bay:**

Allows for deploying ship to ship or orbital bombardment weapons. Torpedos are a purely offensive weapon and are typically equipped on military or pirate spacecraft.

**Bay Data model:**

Bay id:

Bay type: 

Crew capacity:

Cargo capacity:

Torpedo capacity


#### Spacecraft Classes

Note that stat blocks are based on class as general limits. The actual outfitting and carrying capacity of individual craft will vary.

**Patrol Craft**

Light weight craft with small crew and no slip-space drive. Commonly used to navigate planetary space or towed as a landing craft on a larger vessel.



* Class: Patrol Craft
* Gross Tonnage: 10-30
* Net Tonnage: 0-5
* Min Crew: 1
* Max Passengers: 5-10

* Top Speed: 100km/s
* Weapon Ports: 2-6
* Bay Capacity: 3
* Compatible Bays: [Medical, Crew Quarters, Torpedo, Cargo]

**Freighter/Cruiser**

Larger ships depending for hauling cargo or posing a substantial military threat. A fully outfitted military cruiser will deter anything but a full-sized battle barge.



* Class: cruiser
* Gross Tonnage: 100-400
* Net Tonnage: 50-200
* Min Crew: Integer
* Max Passengers: Integer
* Shield Capacity: Integer

### Space Combat

When space combat is initiated each play must choose a station. Players may leave their station as a bonus action on their turn. Each unmanned station will be managed by the ship’s AI. A ship AI may make basic checks, but will not benefit from any bonus provided by player characters. The ship’s AI may also be hacked by hostile forces, rendering the ship helpless unless overwritten by player’s actions.

An individual player may make checks for more than one station, but not on the same turn. 

**Turns**
Each turn lasts 15 seconds of in-game real time. Every player may take an action on a turn. The crew must determine the current vector of the ship. That means the ship's change in direction (if any) and change in velocity.

Turns take place on a radar grid, with each ship and torpedo tracked which we will refer to collectively as "rockets". The position, vector, and velocity of each rocket is updated after each turn.

**Power Output**
The ship's reactor core has a total amount of energy available to it any given point, referred to as "power output". You may choose how to allocate power output on turn by turn basis. The power distribution options are Shields, Engines, and fixed weapons.  Each station may dedicate a percentage of total power output up to 100% of reactor power.

- Calculation for change in velocity
	- Classic Delta-V
	- Available fuel should decrease
	- G Force should be an output, crew will need to roll to withstand
	- Players need some kind of visual feedback system to understand how much of a G force increase a given maneuver will be
- Calculation for increase in damage by weapon
- Calculation for shield energy absorption
- Calculation for heat dissipation from each
- Calculation for fuel consumption


**Stations**

Navigation: A crew member makes a check against their piloting skill against a given difficulty. When evading enemy fire, higher velocity evasive maneuvers will increase the chance of success. This is limited by available fuel and the ability of crew members to endure high G forces. See evasive maneuvers for more details.

  

**Shields**: A crew member makes an intuition check to predict where the shield should be concentrated for impact. If the check is successful, the shield will absorb all of the incoming energy until the shield or incoming energy is consumed. If the check fails, some of the energy will penetrate the shield and damage the hull of the ship.

Calculations:
- Shield overpenetration hull damage

**Comms**: A crew member attempts to hail other ships and makes charisma-based checks to effect the interaction.

**Targeting**: A crew member selects targeting priority and allocated power per weapon on a given turn. This crew member makes luck rolls to see how quickly enemy projectiles can be shot down by  laser turrets each turn.

Calculations:
- Laser turret projectile destruction

**Network Defense**: A crew member attempts to penetrate opponent network defense to weaken or immobilize opposing ship functions.

**Maintenance**: A crew member is an space suit inside the maintenance bay making hardware maintenance checks to identify excessive and address excessive heat buildup. This is a dangerous job, and will require strapping in when the ship engages in high G maneuvers.



#### Evasive Maneuvers

When enemy torpedoes are fired, you may target them with your defense turrets to protect your ship. By pulling out of your currency trajectory you can reroute missiles and provide more time for your defense mechanisms to shoot them down or escape entirely. The difficulty of the evasive maneuver will depend on your ship’s distance to the originating point of the torpedoes, the delta-V of your ship’s new trajectory, and of course a little bit of luck. By forcing the torpedoes to re-route you buy your crew precious minutes to shoot down the torpedoes, or fire your own volley in response.

**How to avoid becoming pink goo**

When your starship starts rapidly changing velocity in a fire fight, the biggest limiter is your character’s ability to withstand the enormous gravitational forces. In a standard space suit, a human can withstand up to 5 times the Earth’s gravity at 50 m/s of acceleration. This will help avoid an enemy rocket but it ain’t great. Different species have varying level of gravitational resistance. During your travels you may find or upgrade your suits and cockpit feature to withstand much higher levels of gravity. Doing so will make it easier to win pitched naval battles with your brains squeezing out of your ears. Note that just because it is not recommended you attempt ill-equipped higher gravity maneuvers doesn’t mean you can’t. It just means that some of your crew members may not survive. 

During an evasive maneuver each character must roll a constitution check. The difficulties are as follows:

3-5g: 5

6-8g: 8

9-11g: 11

12-14g: 14

15-17g: 17

18-20g: 20

20-23g: 23

23g+: impossible

On a failed  check the character falls unconscious. If your character fails a constitution check on an evasive maneuver and their roll is less than half of the required value, they die instantly. \
 
When rolling for evasive maneuvers or when your ship is hit, you must roll for every crew member. This can be done en masse by the GM.


#### Direct Hit

When a projectile hits a ship a few things happen. The type of torpedo will determine it total damage in Joules, and the shield applied at the point of impact will determine how much is absorbed. Once your shield is fully depleted the damage is applied to your ship. Depending on where the torpedo strikes certain functions of your ship will become disabled. Airlocks may be triggered where hull breaches are detected. Your GM will inform you of what parts of your ship are still operable after a torpedo hits.  \
 \
When the ship is directly impacted by damage, roll a luck check for every crew member. For every 1, that crew member dies.

Boarding

Boarding a hostile vessel is the most dangerous and exciting thing you can do in space, second only to being boarded! When in close quarters with an enemy vessel, lander craft can attach and cut their way inside. Lander craft are extremely difficult to remove once attached, but they may be shot down by defensive weaponry while attempting to latch.

### The Lodestone
The Lodestone is the Supermassive Black hole that sits in the nexus of the web of galaxies that comprises our known galaxy. It is populated and developed, as all commercial trade routes utilized its gate system to quickly travers to other markets.

## Eternity's Gates

The Event Horizon of the Lodestone is the termination point of the 21 major cosmic filaments that connect billions of galaxies. 

5 of the 21 filaments are serviced with gates that direct traffic into their connected Super Clusters.

The filaments are labeled:

- AE: Extension of Alpha Centuari and connect super-clusters that Humans traversed in their Odyssey from Sol
- TR: Network of conquered worlds that once comprised the Troydian Empire
- CT: The Altaformed systems of C'Thanian influence and origin
- CAR-0: The first allied system governed by the Confederation of Allied Races with shared trading rules
- CAR-1: A mutual resource extraction venture into a nearby otherwise unexplored cosmic filament

## Lore

This section comprise the major history and storyline of the world of convergencts

### The great odyssey
A thousand years ago the people of humanity were forced to flee their home star system of Sol in the Milky Way galaxy into unknown frontiers. They sought places humanity could flourish and survive in fertile atmosphere. The Milky Way sits adrift the yawing KBC void, which meant humanity's great scientists had to develop FTL (faster than light) travel to cross the empty expanse and reach the vast cosmic filaments of stars that form the highways of the galaxy. 

The invention of Casamir Alloy made possible the conjuring of Einstein-Rosen Bridges to cross vast distances of space. Initial exploratory flights jumped to nearby Super Clusters that first chased solar and planetary systems that could be identified as habitable through visual mediums.

The initial methods were crude, and had the obvious weakness of relying on signals that had been travelling for years through empty space. By the time human craft arrived on distant galaxies, remarkable changes had already taken place. Still, some systems were habitable and patterns began to emerge.

Dense galactic entanglements tended to have more matter and energy than the comparatively cold Milky Way. Atmospheric conditions conducive to carbon based life were more common, though other space faring races were still unknown. Humans began following the cosmic filament of their local super clusters, and thus eventually found their way to rotational point of the entire known universe - the Omega-class supermassive black hole referred to as the Lodestone.

Billions of galaxies wrapped around the Lodestone extend in massive tendrils across the known universe. Though the universe may not all spin around the enormous black hole, it seems that intelligent life does.

And life indeed seems to spring eternal around the maw of eternity, as the colliding matter and energy are the perfect cauldron of chaos to seed new possibilities. The systems that orbit the event horizon of the Lodestone brimming with intelligent life as well as valuable resources. Humans were not the first to arrive in this cosmic Eden, as the Troydians and C'Than had already met and fueded over control over the most valuable region in the universe. 

The end of the Odyssey was humanity's arrival at Eternity's Throne (the Lodestone) and it's official first contact with other intelligent species.
