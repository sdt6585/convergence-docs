## Sprint 03: Game Logic & Integration

**Goal**: Connect UI to game mechanics and database

### Phase 1: Core Game Logic

- [ ] Character/Ship/Equipment classes
- [ ] Combat system
- [ ] Skill checks and dice rolling
- [ ] Event system for abilities

### Phase 2: Database Integration

- [ ] Offline handling

### Phase 3: Integration & Polish

- [ ] Connect all UI components to game logic
- [ ] Add animations and transitions
- [ ] Error handling and recovery
- [ ] Performance optimization
- [ ] Beta testing and refinement

## Development Process

1. **Iterative Development**: Build, test, refine each component before moving on
2. **Designer Collaboration**: Wait for Scott's mockups for each component
3. **Flexible Implementation**: Adjust plans based on testing feedback
4. **Mobile-First**: Ensure all components work on mobile despite desktop-first design

## Key Principles

- Build UI components first, add functionality incrementally
- Test thoroughly before moving to next component
- Keep components modular and reusable
- Prioritize player experience over technical complexity
