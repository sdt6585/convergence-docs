- What function or component makes the call to Supabase to populate data in the browser?
- Where does the global header code live?
- How does the login process work at a high level, with reference to where each function takes place within the code?
- Are we at a point where a reasonable next step would be to create database structure in Supabase so we can populate the game UI with data from Supabase?

- What's the most effective way for us to merge code if what we work might have overlap, should Scott create branches so we can review together before merging?
	- Scott will most be doing mostly sketchy vibe coding
