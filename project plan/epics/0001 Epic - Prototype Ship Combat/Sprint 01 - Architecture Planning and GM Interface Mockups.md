**Goal**: Define the architecture for the Gargantua ship combat system and create mockups for GM interface interaction flows

## High Level Objectives

- Create core system architecture documentation with event-driven approach
- Define data models for ships, characters, abilities, and combat
- Design GM interface mockups and interaction flows
- Implement foundational JavaScript class structure with event system

## Sprint Details

### Architecture Planning

Establish the core architecture and data models for the ship combat system

- [ ] TASK:: Document event-driven architecture approach with diagrams
- [ ] TASK:: Define component interaction model between characters and ships
- [ ] TASK:: Create class diagram for core game objects (Ships, Characters, Combat) [[02 - WIP - Ship Combat Class Diagram]]
- [ ] TASK:: Design entity relationship diagram for database persistence [[01 - WIP ERD]]
- [ ] TASK:: Document WebSocket event propagation for multi-user updates [[03 - WIP - Event Based State Diagram - Ship Combat]]

### GM Interface Design

Create mockups and interaction flows for the Game Master interface

- [ ] TASK:: Review existing wireframe with Scott (game designer) 
- [ ] TASK:: Create detailed mockups for GM ship management screens
    - [ ] TASK:: Design ship overview panel showing stats, crew, weapons
    - [ ] TASK:: Design character management panel showing stats, skills, abilities
    - [ ] TASK:: Design combat log and action resolution panel
- [ ] TASK:: Document interaction flows for common GM actions
    - [ ] TASK:: Combat initiation sequence
    - [ ] TASK:: Ship action resolution process
    - [ ] TASK:: Character skill check workflow
- [ ] TASK:: Create mockups for NPC/enemy management screens

### Core System Implementation

Implement foundational JavaScript classes with event system

- [ ] TASK:: Implement `EventEmitter` base class for event propagation
- [ ] TASK:: Create `Character` class with stats, skills, and ability hooks
- [ ] TASK:: Implement `Ship` class with stations, weapons, and damage system
- [ ] TASK:: Create `ShipStation` class to connect characters to ship functions
- [ ] TASK:: Implement `DiceRoller` utility for skill check resolution
- [ ] TASK:: Create `CombatEncounter` class for turn management
- [ ] TASK:: Document how character abilities hook into ship actions via events

### Technical Setup

Set up project structure and development environment

- [ ] TASK:: Initialize project repository with proper structure
- [ ] TASK:: Set up build process with appropriate tooling
- [ ] TASK:: Configure linting and formatting tools
- [ ] TASK:: Create placeholder documentation files
- [ ] TASK:: Set up test environment with Vitest

### Stretch Goals

- [ ] TASK:: Create simple proof-of-concept for character-to-ship ability effects
- [ ] TASK:: Create initial working sample of a ship combat action with dice rolls
- [ ] TASK:: Set up placeholder Supabase project for future authentication work
