## Tactical Radar System: Multi-Scale Space Navigation and Combat Interface

The Tactical Radar System serves as the primary spatial awareness interface in Convergence, providing players with critical navigation, exploration, and combat capabilities across three distinct operational scales. This comprehensive visualization system transforms complex space navigation into an intuitive experience while maintaining the strategic depth required for meaningful tactical decision-making.

At its core, the radar system operates as a real-time representation of space around the player's vessel, adapting its display based on the current operational context. The system seamlessly transitions between three primary modes: Galaxy View for strategic navigation between star systems, Scanner View for local system exploration, and Combat View for tactical engagements. Each mode presents information optimized for its specific use case while maintaining consistent interaction patterns that players can master across all scales.

The Galaxy View presents a simplified star map showing accessible star systems as single points representing their primary celestial body, typically the system's star. This abstraction allows players to focus on strategic movement decisions without overwhelming detail. When selecting a destination system, the interface calculates jump requirements, fuel consumption, and any associated costs for using commercial jump gates versus ship-based FTL capabilities. Travel at this scale is effectively instantaneous once initiated, reflecting the nature of faster-than-light transportation.

Scanner View activates when players enter a star system, revealing a detailed two-dimensional representation of local space. This mode displays all significant celestial bodies, including planets, moons, asteroid fields, space stations, and other vessels within sensor range. The scanner's effectiveness directly correlates with the ship's sensor capabilities, which are influenced by installed equipment, crew skills, and special abilities. Objects beyond sensor range remain hidden, creating opportunities for exploration and tactical surprises. Players can interact with detected objects to initiate scans for additional information, plot intercept courses, or prepare for planetary landings.

Combat View engages automatically when hostile vessels are detected or weapons are activated, providing the most detailed tactical interface. This mode employs realistic two-dimensional physics simulation, modeling ship momentum, acceleration capabilities, and weapon trajectories. The distinctive feature of Combat View is its trajectory prediction system, which displays a complex polygon representing all possible positions the player's ship could occupy at the end of the current turn, based on available thrust and maneuvering capabilities.

The physics engine underlying Combat and Scanner views models Newtonian mechanics in two dimensions. Ships maintain velocity unless actively changing course, requiring careful management of fuel resources and consideration of G-force limitations on the crew. When planning maneuvers, players use an innovative click-and-drag interface to set their desired heading and thrust level. The system provides immediate feedback on fuel consumption and G-force exposure, allowing players to balance aggressive maneuvering against resource conservation and crew safety.

Weapon systems integration showcases the depth of the physics simulation. Missiles and torpedoes track targets with limited maneuvering capability, while mass drivers and similar weapons follow ballistic trajectories that players must calculate based on target movement prediction. Energy weapons like lasers strike instantaneously but are limited by range and power availability. The combat system emphasizes tactical positioning, as ships must manage their orientation, velocity, and distance to effectively engage enemies while minimizing their own exposure.

The user interface employs a consistent visual language across all three modes. Concentric circles indicate distance scales, with dynamic adjustment based on zoom level. Objects are represented by distinct iconography that conveys type, allegiance, and status at a glance. Color coding differentiates between friendly, neutral, hostile, and unknown contacts, while additional visual indicators show selection status, targeting locks, and trajectory projections.

Interaction patterns prioritize intuitive control while accommodating multiple input methods. Players can zoom using plus/minus buttons, mouse wheel rotation, touchpad gestures, or pinch-zoom on touchscreens. Map panning works through click-and-drag or touch-based dragging. Right-click or long-press actions open context menus with object-specific options, streamlining complex commands into accessible interfaces.

The turn-based nature of Convergence integrates seamlessly with the radar system. During each 15-second turn interval, players plan their movements and actions using the interface, with the trajectory prediction system showing where their choices will lead. Once all players commit their actions, the system resolves movement and combat simultaneously, with results animated on each client's display. This approach eliminates latency concerns while maintaining the tension of simultaneous decision-making.

Multiplayer functionality leverages Supabase's real-time capabilities to synchronize game state across all connected clients. Rather than streaming continuous position updates, the system transmits turn resolutions, allowing each client to independently animate the results. This architecture ensures consistent gameplay regardless of connection quality while reducing bandwidth requirements.

Sensor range calculations create meaningful tactical considerations, as different ships and crews possess varying detection capabilities. A well-equipped scout vessel might detect threats long before they become aware of its presence, while a heavily armed battleship might have limited sensor range but overwhelming firepower. These asymmetries encourage diverse fleet compositions and tactical approaches.

The radar system's modular design accommodates future expansion through its object-oriented architecture. New object types, interaction patterns, or physics behaviors can be added without disrupting existing functionality. This extensibility ensures the system can grow alongside the game's feature set, supporting new ship classes, weapon systems, or environmental hazards as development continues.

By combining intuitive visualization with deep tactical mechanics, the Tactical Radar System transforms the complexity of space navigation into an engaging, accessible experience. Players progress from basic movement commands to sophisticated tactical planning, with the interface revealing additional depth as their understanding grows. This layered approach ensures that new players can quickly grasp essential concepts while veteran commanders discover nuanced strategies through extended play.

The system ultimately serves as more than just a navigation tool—it becomes the lens through which players experience the vastness of space, the tension of combat, and the wonder of exploration. Every zoom adjustment, every trajectory calculation, and every sensor sweep reinforces the game's core themes of human ambition among the stars, where knowledge, preparation, and split-second decisions determine the difference between triumph and disaster.
