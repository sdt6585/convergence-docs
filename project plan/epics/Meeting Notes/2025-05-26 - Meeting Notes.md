Plan:
 - Demo AI integration into character creation
 - Discuss Lore - update notes
	 - Sol system and milky way - we are in a relative void
	 - Kasimere alloy to maintain portals - slip space map
		 - Cosmic fillament - intersection of galaxies, when they got there - 
		 - War once they got to the center - over resources - rare anti-matter/exotic matter generated by blackhole
		 - Troydians - militaristic, high g maneuvars
		 - C'than - smart but can't take high g maneuvers
	 - Core gameplay loop:
		 - People at stations optionally - choose a location
			 - System map view
 - Trial game play - 
	 - Use prototype to imagine clicking the interface or dictating, or typing into the LLM
	 - Record audio/video of screen
	 - Define Core NPC's
		 - 1-2 - Quest giver, companion (temp), story sharer device
		 - Enemies/NPC's - unique abilities, background, equipment, stats, skills, etc
		 - Automoton/Droid
			 - Generic race called creature with subtypes maybe?
			 - Drone might be different than droid - it's a ship with no crew
			 - Need to be able to give them special equipment that gives them specific skills and unrealistic stat combiations
	 - **Character creation - does it need to be attached to a location**
		 - Yes
	 - **Inventory Management**
		 - Add to character
		 - Max carry weight for character based on constitution/strength
		 - Ship - max tonnage
		 - 
	 - **May need to roll against an NPC**

		 - Chat - roll deception gen akbar
