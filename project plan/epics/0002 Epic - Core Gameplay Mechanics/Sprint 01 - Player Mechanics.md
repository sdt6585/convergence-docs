## User Story

As a player of of Convergence, I need to be able to quickly access my options as a character so I can respond as the game changes in real-time. It's important that my options are easy to find and understand, so that I can assess what my options are and make a decision as my character would.

## Scope

Make the player actions easily accessible to do any of 3 different primary decision trees:

- Make a skill check
- Update their inventory
- Attack
