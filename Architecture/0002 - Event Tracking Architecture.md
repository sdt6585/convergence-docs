## Event Schema Design

### Standard Event Structure

```json
{
  "event_id": "uuid-v4",
  "timestamp": "2024-06-15T10:30:00.000Z",
  "user_id": "user_12345",
  "session_id": "session_67890",
  "event_name": "feature_used",
  "event_version": "1.0",
  "properties": {
    "feature_name": "advanced_analytics",
    "feature_category": "analytics",
    "plan_type": "enterprise",
    "usage_duration": 180
  },
  "context": {
    "page_url": "https://app.example.com/analytics",
    "user_agent": "Mozilla/5.0...",
    "ip_address": "192.168.1.1",
    "referrer": "https://app.example.com/dashboard",
    "device_type": "desktop",
    "browser": "chrome",
    "os": "windows"
  },
  "user_properties": {
    "subscription_tier": "enterprise",
    "signup_date": "2024-01-15",
    "industry": "fintech",
    "company_size": "201-500"
  }
}
```

### Event Taxonomy Framework

**Acquisition Events**
- `user_signed_up`
- `game_created`
- `character_created`

**Engagement Events**
- `user_logged_in`
- `game_session_started`
- `game_session_ended`
- `rolled`
- `skill_leveled`
- `class_leveled`
- `item_added`

**Conversion Events**
- `payment_completed`




## Use Case Implementation

### 1. Customer Experience & Retention Analytics

**Real-Time Dashboards**
- User journey visualization with Sankey diagrams
- Feature adoption funnels with cohort analysis
- Session replay integration for UX optimization
- Anomaly detection for product issues

**Retention Analysis**
- Cohort retention tables with statistical significance testing
- Churn prediction using gradient boosting models
- Customer health scoring with multi-dimensional metrics
- Proactive intervention triggers based on behavior patterns

**Technical Implementation**
```python
# Example: Real-time retention scoring
def calculate_retention_score(user_events):
    features = {
        'days_since_last_login': calculate_days_since_last_login(user_events),
        'feature_adoption_rate': calculate_feature_adoption(user_events),
        'support_ticket_count': count_support_interactions(user_events),
        'subscription_tier': get_subscription_tier(user_events)
    }
    return ml_model.predict_retention_probability(features)
```

### 2. Personalized Game Recommendations

**Recommendation Engine Architecture**
- Collaborative filtering using Apache Mahout or Surprise
- Content-based filtering with TF-IDF vectorization
- Deep learning models using TensorFlow or PyTorch
- A/B testing framework for recommendation optimization

**Real-Time Personalization**
- Item and location suggestions to the Game Master based on player choices
- NPC trait creation based on previous interactions
- Enemy personalization based on player combat style

**Implementation Pattern**
```python
# Example: Real-time recommendation serving
@app.route('/api/recommendations/<user_id>')
def get_recommendations(user_id):
    user_profile = get_user_profile(user_id)
    recent_events = get_recent_events(user_id, hours=24)
    
    # Real-time feature extraction
    features = extract_features(user_profile, recent_events)
    
    # Model inference
    recommendations = recommendation_model.predict(features)
    
    # A/B testing and personalization
    return personalize_recommendations(recommendations, user_profile)
```

### 3. Marketing Cohort Creation & Lookalike Audiences

**Ideal Customer Profile (ICP) Identification**
- RFM analysis (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) for customer segmentation
- Clustering algorithms (K-means, DBSCAN) for behavioral grouping
- Statistical significance testing for segment validation
- Customer lifetime value (CLV) modeling

**Lookalike Audience Generation**
- Feature engineering from behavioral and demographic data
- Similarity scoring using cosine similarity or Jaccard index
- Facebook/Google Ads API integration for audience sync
- Continuous model retraining with feedback loops

**Segmentation Strategy**
- High-value power users (top 10% by engagement and revenue)
- Feature champions (early adopters of new functionality)
- At-risk customers (declining engagement patterns)
- Expansion opportunities (usage patterns indicating upgrade potential)

## Best Practices & Implementation Guidelines
